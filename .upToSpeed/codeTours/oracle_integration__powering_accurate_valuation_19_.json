It performs important validations:\n   - Ensures the number of ratios matches the number of underlying tokens.\n   - Verifies that the cumulative ratio equals Q96 (2^96), maintaining precision.\n\n2. getTargetRatiosX96: Retrieves the current target ratios for a vault.\n\n3. tokensHash: A unique hash of the vault's underlying tokens, used to validate that the stored ratios correspond to the current set of tokens.\n\nThese features ensure that ratio updates are secure, accurate, and aligned with the vault's current token composition. The ManagedRatiosOracle plays a vital role in maintaining the desired token allocation within the vault, directly impacting deposit and withdrawal operations.",

Lines 311-317: It calculates the deposit ratio based on these target ratios, ensuring balanced deposits.\n3. Lines 319-341: The Vault uses the ChainlinkOracle (via priceOracle) to get token prices and calculate total value.\n4. Lines 323-328: Price data is fetched for each token, crucial for accurate valuation.\n5.

Committing: After a delay, the admin can finalize the change (e.g., commitPriceOracle, commitRatiosOracle).\n\nThis process allows for review and provides a window to detect and prevent malicious changes. The contract also includes rollback functions as an additional safety measure.\n\nNote the separate functions for price and ratios oracles, reflecting their distinct roles in the system.
