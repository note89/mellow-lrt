The `swap` function is the core of this module, allowing for flexible token swaps.\n2. It uses a `SwapParams` struct to define swap parameters, ensuring precise control over trades.\n3. The module interacts with external swap contracts (like Uniswap) through a low-level `call`, allowing for adaptability to different DEX interfaces.\n4. It implements safety checks for deadlines, swap amounts, and successful execution.\n5. The module emits an event after each swap, providing transparency and facilitating off-chain tracking.\n\nThis integration allows Mellow LRT to leverage Uniswap's liquidity and pricing mechanisms, enhancing its ability to manage and rebalance token holdings efficiently.",
