Common Patterns:\n   - Both use delegateCall to interact with their respective modules\n   - Both implement withdrawal processing\n   - Both are integrated with the Vault\n\n2. Unique Features:\n   - DefaultBondStrategy: Manages multiple bonds with ratio-based allocation\n   - SimpleDVTStakingStrategy: Handles staking operations with a single asset\n\n3. Flexibility:\n   - The strategy system allows for different yield generation mechanisms\n   - New strategies can be easily integrated by implementing the required interfaces\n\nThis modular design enables the Mellow LRT system to adapt to various DeFi protocols and yield opportunities, showcasing the extensibility of the strategy system.",
