      "description": "Welcome to the code tour of the Vault System project. This project implements a sophisticated decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol for managing liquid restaking tokens (LRT). The system is designed with modularity, flexibility, and security in mind, allowing for efficient asset management and integration with various DeFi protocols. Throughout this tour, we'll explore the core components and their interactions, focusing on the main Vault contract and its supporting modules.",

ERC20: Implements the standard token interface, enabling the Vault to mint and manage LP tokens.\n2. DefaultAccessControl: Provides role-based access control, crucial for secure administrative functions.\n3. ReentrancyGuard: Protects against reentrancy attacks, a common vulnerability in DeFi protocols.\n\nThese inheritances combine token functionality, granular permissions, and security measures, forming a robust foundation for the Vault's operations. Note the use of libraries for enhanced functionality:",

The Vault uses these modules to aggregate TVL data across various tokens and protocols it interacts with. This modular approach enables easy integration of new assets or protocols without modifying the core Vault logic.\n\nThe `tvl` function in this interface is called by the Vault to retrieve TVL data for specific users or the entire system, supporting functions like deposit and withdrawal calculations.",
